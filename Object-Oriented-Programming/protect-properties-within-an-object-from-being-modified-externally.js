// In the previous challenge, bird had a public property name. It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird's definition.

bird.name = "Duffy";
// Therefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.

// The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.

function Bird() {
  let hatchedEgg = 10;

  this.getHatchedEggCount = function() { 
    return hatchedEgg;
  };
}
let ducky = new Bird();
ducky.getHatchedEggCount();
// Here getHatchedEggCount is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable hatchedEgg. This is possible because hatchedEgg is declared in the same context as getHatchedEggCount. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.


// Protected properties are usually prefixed with an underscore _:
class CoffeeMachine {
  _waterAmount = 20;

  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) {
      value = 0;
    }
    this._waterAmount = value;
  }

  get waterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

console.log(coffeeMachine); // { _waterAmount: 20, _power: 100 }

console.log(coffeeMachine.waterAmount); // 20
// set waterAmount to be 30:
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = 30;
console.log(coffeeMachine.waterAmount); // 30

// try to set waterAmount to a negative number:
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = -10;
console.log(coffeeMachine.waterAmount) // 0


// Read-only "power":
// For power property, letâ€™s make it read-only. It sometimes happens that a property must be set at creation time only, and then never modified.
class CoffeeMachine {
  // ...

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

  get power() {
    return this._power;
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

alert(`Power is: ${coffeeMachine.power}W`); // Power is: 100W

coffeeMachine.power = 25; // Error (no setter)
